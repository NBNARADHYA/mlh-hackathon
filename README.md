# 1-on-1 Solana NFT Badges

**Background**    
- For our MLH Orientation Hackathon, we had the idea of creating NFTs to be awarded to our peers.     
- Using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), we were able to design a series of images to be used for NFTS for our MLH Fellowship Pod.    
- The images designed on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) were packaged as png and JSON files using [Treat Toolbox](https://github.com/theskeletoncrew/treat-toolbox).     
- Next, utilizing [Metaplex](https://www.metaplex.com/), these file pairs were combined to create and upload NFTs.

**This project provides a front end for minting NFTS using [Candy Machine Mint v2](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/tree/master/js/packages/candy-machine-ui).**     
- By selecting one of us from the dropdown menu, users will be granted an NFT created by us.    
- These NFTs will be awarded to those who complete a 1-on-1 with someone on our team.    
- A future goal is to airdrop a bonus to those who complete a 1-on-1 with all four of us.
