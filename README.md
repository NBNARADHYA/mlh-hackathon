# 1-on-1 Solana NFT Badges

**Background**    
For our MLH Orientation Hackathon, we had the idea of creating NFTs to be awarded to our peers.     
Using Figma, we were able to design a series of images to be used for NFTS for our MLH Fellowship Pod.    
The images designed on Figma were packaged as png and JSON files using Treat Toolbox.     
Next, utilizing Metaplex, these file pairs were combined to create and upload NFTs.        


**This project provides a front end for minting NFTS using Candy Machine Mint v2.**     
By selecting one of us from the dropdown menu, users will be granted an NFT created by us!    
These NFTs will be awarded to those who complete a 1-on-1 with someone on our team.    
A future goal is to airdrop a bonus to those who complete a 1-on-1 with all four of us.
